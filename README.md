# Android QR Scanner
This was a project back in university... it's simple stuff, and I haven't had time to set my Android/Java dev environment back up to get back into tinkering around with Java as of late.

- Note: This project probably may not work right away. I'll have to make some time to fix any issues, if applicable.

- Another note: This requires the Zebra Crossing (zxing/zxing here on Github) library. You'll notice that in *project.properties* (and probably other places as well...).
